# Web-Development--Student-Internship-System

Full Stack Web Development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).

Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex Web-based Internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.
A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development,
client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. 

Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding.
Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills. For larger organizations and businesses.
Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.

Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department.
There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.

Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web, Web development has been a growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their Web site to advertise and sell products and services to customers.
There are many open-source tools for Web development such as Berkeley DB, Glass Fish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack.

This has kept the cost of learning Web development to a minimum. Knowledge of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly. An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive web sites. Further, Web developers now help to deliver applications as Web services which were traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer.
